# Food-Delivery-App-Data-Analysis

This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for better upcoming performance, and how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database.

# Module 1
In this module, I used python to preprocess the data by handling null values, removing unwanted columns, dealing with duplicates and text cleaning.
Once this is done, we get a cleaned dataset that can be used for further analysis.

# Module 2
Data Analysis using SQL
Using the cleaned data, we perform sql queries on the data for analysis.
